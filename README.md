# PerpleCXX
A somewhat crazy and rather ambitious project that aim to completely rewrite and modernize the Perple_X metamorphic petrology calculation code (https://www.perplex.ethz.ch/ & https://petrol.natur.cuni.cz/~ondro/perplex-sources-latest.zip) using the C++ programming language and its fine object-oriented capabilities. It also implies the use of code parallelization (both threads and MPI), command line standalone usage, the possibility to be used as a library to be plugged into geodynamics codes (like ASPECT: https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect) or python code and the usage of modern congfiguration file formats (YAML and-or JSON)
