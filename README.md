# PerpleCXX
A somewhat crazy project that aim to completely rewrite and modernize the Perple_X metamorphic petrology calculation code using the C++ programming language. It also implies the use of parallelization and the possibiliy of using it as a library to be plugged into geodynamics codes (like ASPECT)
